        - `--cleanup-time` allow child processes to clean up between stop / kill signals
        - `--immediate-output` print output immediately and interleaved, to aid debugging

- rush v0.3.0
    - Added `--propagate-exit-status` command line arg, default true.
    Propagates child process exit status to rush exit status, so rush fails if a child fails
